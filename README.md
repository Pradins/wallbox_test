# Wallbox nodejs team offline technical test

Heey! If you're reading this is because you've been selected to proceed for a node related position at Wallbox ‚ö°! For this next step, you will need to carry out some offline assessments. This includes a questionnaire and a coding challenge. We've tried to explain everything you need to perform the tests in the markdown files. However, we might have written something that is confusing or missed some information that you consider is important to know. If so, do not hesitate to ask since it will also help us to improve our technical tests! Good luck üçÄ!

## Code challenge

You will find all the instructions you need to perform the code challenge inside the `code-challenge` folder's [README.md](./code-challenge/README.md) file.

## Important

Please, don't make the test public (like uploading it to GitHub).

We invested some thinking and shaping into this test and would like to be able to continue using it for future candidates like you.

## What's next?

We'll let you know something as soon as we have reviewed your tests. If you match our requirements we'll proceed with the next step: an online coding session ü§ì ! Otherwise, we'll try to give you our opinion on what we think it can be improved. We really value your time and effort doing these tests and since we are grateful for this and we value our candidates we'll try to provide the proper feedback you deserve üôÇ .

If you are notified to proceed with the hiring process, find here some useful resources we consider that can help you for the online coding session:

- Test that you can share your screen using your preferred browser.
- Have your offline coding challenge on hand.
- Be ready to code üíª !
